   <title>Slow network connection to Green Bank</title>
   <description><![CDATA[
Something is happening to the network connection between Green Bank and Berkeley that is slowing down the rate at which we can transfer data for splitting.  We've opened a trouble ticket with campus networking services.  Hopefully they will be able to find and fix the problem quickly.  Until then, work may be in short supply.
